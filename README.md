## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Using React
In order to use a react component in your blade template, create a component in scripts/components in PascalCase. 

When done, import that component in scripts/app.js and add it to the components object as is done with the example component. 
In the main blade template add `<script src="{{mix('js/app.js')}}"></script>`.

If you want to use a created component in your template add an empty element and add the `data-component="<ComponentName>"` to that element in order to use the component, where `<ComponentName>` is replaced with your components name.

If you also want to give properties to that component add the `data-prop-<PropName>="<PropValue>"` attribute to the element, where `<PropName>` is to be replaced with the properties name and `<PropValue>` with the properties value.

Example of een element using react and having properties: `<div data-component="Example" data-prop-test="aTest"></div>`.
